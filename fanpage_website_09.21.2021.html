    <h1>Short Bio about Ludwig Van Beethoven</h1>
   
   
    <p>Born in Bonn of Northern Germany, Ludwig Van Beethoven started learning piano with several teachers including his own father Johann Van Beethoven, Christian Gottlob Neefe, and
        later Helen Von Breuning. Each time period of his music career features at least one piece even a casual Classical Genre fan or listener would know of. 
        Beethoven started losing his hearing in 1801 and continued composing until 1826. His final symphony was Symphony No. 9. When sitting in on his first lesson and meeting with Mozart,
        Beethoven played some of Mozart's on pieces, to which W.A. Mozart was not impressed. But when Beethoven started improvising, and using his own style to play piano, to which W.A. Mozart said "Now <i>that</i> is something. <i>That</i> is good piano!"
