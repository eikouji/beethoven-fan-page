# first-html-ever - A LV Beethoven Fan Page

A pre-Coding-Bootcamp project asking me to build a simple fanpage for a favorite band. I chose Mr. Ludwig Van Beethoven as my "band". 

Branch 1 - Main, ReadMe, original project, turned in on Oct 19th or so.


Branch 2- Redo Project, Done 1 month after coding school has started.
